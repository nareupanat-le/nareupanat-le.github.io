    I am working on ideal theory in ordered semigroups.
    Let me provide some brief concepts of ideals in ordered semigroups as follows.
  </p>
  <p class="justify">
    An <em>ordered semigroup</em> is an algebraic system $\langle S; \cdot, \leq \rangle$ consisting of a nonempty set $S$, an associative binary operation $\cdot$ on $S$, and a partial order $\leq$ defined on $S$ such that the partial order is compatible with the binary operation $\cdot$.
  </p>
  <p class="justify">
    If $\langle S; \cdot, \leq \rangle$ is an ordered semigroup, we denote the product of elements in $S$ by avoding the symbol $\cdot$.
    By writing the parentheses can be skipt since the operation $\cdot$ is associative.
    For an element $a$ of $S$ and any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we write the $n$-product of $a$ by $a^n$.
    For the convenience, we denote an ordered semigroup $\langle S; \cdot, \leq \rangle$ by $\mathbf{S}$ the boldface of its underlying set.
  </p>
  <p class="justify">
    Let $\mathbf{S}$ be an ordered semigroup.
    The operation $\cdot$ defined on $S$ can be extended to $\mathcal{P}(S)$ the set of all subsets of $S$, defined by $AB := \{ ab : a \in A \text{ and } b \in B \}$.
    We note here that $AB = \emptyset$ if $A$ or $B$ is empty.
    For a nonempty subset $A$ of $S$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we denote the $n$-product of $A$ by $A^n$.
    We set $A^0B = B = BA^0$ for any nonempty subsets $A$ and $B$ of $S$.
    Moreover, the partial order $\leq$ induces a subset $(A]$ of $S$ defined by $(A] := \{ x \in S : x \leq a \text{ for some } a \in A \}$ for all $A \subseteq S$.
  </p>
  <p class="justify">
    Now, let me recall some of the important substructures of ordered semigroups.
    Let $\mathbf{S}$ be an ordered semigroup.
    A nonempty subset $A$ of $S$ is said to be a <em>subsemigroup</em> of $\mathbf{S}$ if $AA \subseteq A$.
    We call a subsemigroup $A$ of an ordered semigroup $\mathbf{S}$ satisfying $(A] \subseteq A$:
    <ul>
      <li>a <em>left ideal</em> of $\mathbf{S}$ if $SA \subseteq A$;</li>
      <li>a <em>right ideal</em> of $\mathbf{S}$ if $AS \subseteq A$;</li>
      <li>a <em>two-sided ideal</em> of $\mathbf{S}$ if $A$ is both a left and a right ideal of $\langle S; \cdot, \leq \rangle$;</li>
      <li>a <em>quasi-ideal</em> of $\mathbf{S}$ if $(AS] \cap (SA] \subseteq A$;</li>
      <li>a <em>bi-ideal</em> of $\mathbf{S}$ if $ASA \subseteq A$;</li>
      <li>an <em>interior ideal</em> of $\mathbf{S}$ if $SAS \subseteq A$.</li>
    </ul>
    In certain literatures, the subsemigroup property of bi-ideals and interior ideals is not necessary.
    However, in this note such a property is required.
  </p>
  <p class="justify">
    The above ideals are classical substructures used to investigate several algebraic properties of ordered semigroups.
    Nevertheless, these notions are extended into the notions of $(m,n)$-ideals and $n$-interior ideals as follows.
  </p>
  <p class="justify">
    Let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$, not all zero.
    A subsemigroup $A$ of an ordered semigroup $\mathbf{S}$ satisfying $(A] \subseteq A$ is said to be:
    <ul>
      <li>an <em>(m,n)-ideal</em> of $\mathbf{S}$ if $A^mSA^n \subseteq A$;</li>
      <li>an <em>$n$-interior ideal</em> of $\mathbf{S}$ if $SA^nS \subseteq A$.</li>
    </ul>
    We observe that a left, a right, bi-, and an interior ideal is a $(0,1)$-, a $(1,0)$, a $(1,1)$-, and $1$-interior ideal.
    Therefore, the notions of $(m,n)$-ideals and $n$-interior ideals are generalizations of certain ideals.
  </p>
  <p class="justify">
    However, the notions of $(m,n)$-ideals and $n$-interior ideals in ordered semigroups can be defined in a more abstract way.
    It was started in semigroup theory, in 1989, 
  </p>
  <p class="justify">
    On March, 2022, I was assigned by MathSciNet to review a paper written by Niovi Kehayopulu.
    The paper considered three related concepts: $poe$-semigroups, $\vee e$-semigroups, and $le$-semigroups.
  </p>
  <p class="justify">
    A <em>$poe$-semigroup</em> $\mathbf{S}$ is an ordered semigroup having the greatest element $e$.
    That is, $x \leq e$ for all $x \in S$.
    An algebra $\langle S; \cdot, \vee \rangle$ of type $(2,2)$ is said to be a <em>$\vee e$-semigroup</em> if $\langle S; \cdot \rangle$ is a semigroup, $\langle S; \vee \rangle$ is a joint-semilattice with the greatest element $e$, and the operation $\cdot$ distributes over $\vee$.
    Finally, an algebra $\langle S; \cdot, \vee, \wedge \rangle$ is called an <em>lattice ordered semigroup with the greatest element</em> or <em>$le$-semigroup</em> if $\langle S; \cdot \rangle$ is a semigroup, $\langle S; \vee, \wedge \rangle$ is a lattice with the greatest element $e$, and the operation $\cdot$ distributes over $\vee$.
    It is not difficult to see that we can regard a $\vee e$-semigroup and an $le$-semigroup as a $poe$-semigroup in a natural way.
    This means that the above three structures are ordered semigroups.
  </p>
  <p class="justify">
    Kehayopulu described the relationships of (hyper)ideals among these three related structures and others, for instance, (ordered) semigroup and (ordered) hypersemigroups.
    Moreover, the past study of Kehayopulu implies that the concept of $poe$-semigroups is a representation of ordered semigroups.
    This study inspired me for further study of ideals in these three structures.
